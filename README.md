# Number Plate Recognition and Extraction

Overview
This Python project is designed to recognize and extract text from vehicle number plates in images. By combining computer vision and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), it automates the detection and reading of license plates, making it ideal for applications in traffic management, toll systems, parking, and law enforcement.

Features
* Automatic Detection: Identifies number plates in images with high accuracy.
* OCR Integration: Extracts alphanumeric text from detected plates.
* Robust Preprocessing: Handles noise, varying lighting, and diverse plate designs.
* Batch Processing: Supports single image or batch operations.
* Extensibility: Modular design allows for easy integration with other systems.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
OpenCV: For image processing and number plate detection.
Tesseract OCR: To extract text from detected regions.
NumPy: For numerical operations.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-plate-recognition.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd number-plate-recognition

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare your input image(s):
Place your image(s) in the images/ directory.

Run the script:
python recognize_plate.py --image <path_to_image>

Example:
python recognize_plate.py --image images/car.jpg

View the results:
The detected number plate and extracted text will be displayed and optionally saved.

How It Works
Image Preprocessing:
Enhances image quality to improve detection accuracy.
Includes resizing, grayscaling, and noise reduction.

Plate Detection:
Uses OpenCV to locate contours or regions resembling number plates.

Text Extraction:
Passes the detected plate region to Tesseract OCR to extract text.

Output:
Displays the text on the console and saves it for further use.

Applications
Automated toll collection systems.
Parking lot management.
Traffic monitoring and violation detection.
Vehicle tracking and fleet management.
